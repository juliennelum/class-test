- Update /var/www/index.html with 
  o New OWASP BWA version number
  o New applications (if appropriate)
  o Updated application version numbers (if appropriate)
- Clean up any data in applications / databases by running owaspbwa-reset-databases.sh
- Run owaspbwa-modsecurity-crs-off.sh to ensure that the ModSecurity Core Rule Set is not logging or blocking requests.
- Stop services by running owaspbwa-services-stop.sh
- Commit changes to SVN
- Copy owaspbwa-readme.txt out of the VM (or SVN repository) into directory where VM is located on host
- On console, go to single user mode by running init 1
- At root prompt, run owaspbwa-delete-temp-and-log-files.sh
- At root prompt, run owaspbwa-zero-free-space.sh
- Power off VM
- Update summary information in VMware with new version number
- Close VM in VMware Workstation
- Shrink disk on Windows command line with 
> "c:\Program Files\VMware\VMware Workstation\vmware-vdiskmanager.exe" -k "OWASP Broken Web Apps.vmdk"
OR (on 64-bit Windows)
> "c:\Program Files (x86)\VMware\VMware Workstation\vmware-vdiskmanager.exe" -k -q "OWASP Broken Web Apps-cl1.vmdk"
- Delete vmware*.log files from VM directory
- Use 7-zip to compress directory with VM.  Follow the Windows "platform convention" of not including the directory in the .7z or .zip file.
- Use VMware's OVFTool to create the .ova version with a command line the follow (replace 1.1.1 with the appropriate version number): 
> "c:\Program Files\VMware\VMware OVF Tool\ovftool.exe" "OWASP Broken Web Apps.vmx" ..\OWASP_Broken_Web_Apps_VM_1.1.1.ova
- Generate MD5's for 3 distribution files (.zip, .7z, and .ova). These will be verified with what SourceForge reports after uploading the files there.
